# Customer_Analytics
Project code of end to end analytics software that uses Talend Open Studio, MongoDB and R Tool.

Customer insights are key ingredients of ecommerce analytics. These insights are created by analysing the
customer data, interpreting it and converting it into charts and reports that is displayed on a mobile or web
application. End to end analytics software has many parts, right from getting data, transforming data to displaying
result. This particular technique establishes a connection with the ftp location where the customer data has been
uploaded by the ecommerce. This ftp location can be a Salesforce location, Amazon server location or the local
host of the ecommerce system. Whatever the ftp location maybe, first task is to establish a connection with it. Second
step of this technique involves the usage of an ETL module. This module is used to extract the customer data
from the ftp location, transform the data according to the requirement for performing analytics and loading the
transformed data into a database. The last step of this technique is to use the transformed data stored in the
database to create the graphs and reports to provide customer insights to the marketing head of an ecommerce. After generating these
graphs and reports, they are supposed to be displayed on a mobile or web application where the insights can be easily
accessed and thus important decisions can be made easily. Instead of having two steps of generating reports and
displaying the results, there are business intelligence tools that combine the steps into one. There are many open -
source as well as enterprise business intelligence tools that should be chosen depending upon the need of marketing head.
